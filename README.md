# ESP-WROOM-32-38pin ST7789 240x240px Display

* "Game of life" with changable rules for experiments and fun 

* Easy rules modifying 

* Portable for many TFT displays such as ILI9341 

* Randomly generated maps so you are only changing rules

* Game of life : B3/S2-3

* Coral: B3/S45678

* Larger than life: R5/B34-45/S33-57

## Example settings for "Larger than life"
* neighbors_min     33 - minimal neighbors cout to survive 
* neighbors_max     57 - maximal neighbors cout to survive
* neighbors_to_spawn_min 34 - count of neighbors to spawn new pixel
* neighbors_to_spawn_max 45 - count of neighbors to spawn new pixel
* Spawn_probability 40 - probability in[%] to spawn in first iterration 
* neighbors_range   5 - range of neighbors around
  
```bash
N - neighbor                         N N N N N
C - cell                             N N N N N
             N N N                   N N C N N
             N C N                   N N N N N
             N N N <- range = 1      N N N N N <- range = 2
```
